    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wait a second, this isn't bread. To that I say, <em>you're right</em>, but it's made of wheat so it's close enough. Plus you're probably not here to actually use these recipes anyways.</p>
    <p>It's kind of funny that I'm using mac and cheese as an example recipe for this page considering that I've never created mac and cheese using anything but a kraft box of easy mac.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
    </ol>
